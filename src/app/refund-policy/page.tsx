          This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or seek a refund for
          a product / service that you have purchased through the Platform. Under this policy:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made 1 days of placing the
            order. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have
            been communicated to such sellers / merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they
            have initiated the process of shipping them, or the product is out for delivery.
            In such an event, you may choose to reject the product at the doorstep.
          </li>
          <li>
            DocuEase does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers,
            eatables, etc. However, the refund / replacement can be made if the user
            establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not good.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report to our customer
            service team. The request would be entertained once the seller/ merchant listed on
            the Platform, has checked and determined the same at its own end. This should be
            reported within 1 days of receipt of products. In case you feel that the product
            received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it
            to the notice of our customer service within 1 days of receiving the product. The
            customer service team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate
            decision.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case of complaints regarding the products that come with a warranty from the
            manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case of any refunds approved by DocuEase, it will take 4 days for the refund to
            be processed to you.
